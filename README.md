# Period-1 Vanilla JavaScript, Es-next, Node.js, Babel + Webpack and TypeScript-1

## Explain and Reflect:
- Explain the differences between Java and JavaScript + node. Topics you could include:

  - that Java is a compiled language and JavaScript a scripted language

  -  Java is both a language and a platform

  - General differences in language features.

  - Blocking vs. non-blocking

- Explain generally about node.js, when it “makes sense” and npm, and how it “fits” into the node echo system.

- Explain about the Event Loop in JavaScript, including terms like; blocking, non-blocking, event loop, callback queue and "other" API's. Make sure to include why this is relevant for us as developers.

- What does it mean if a method in nodes API's ends with xxxxxxSync?

- Explain the terms JavaScript Engine (name at least one) and JavaScript Runtime Environment (name at least two)

- Explain (some) of the purposes with the tools Babel and WebPack and how they differ from each other. Use examples from the exercises.

## Explain using sufficient code examples the following features in JavaScript (and node)

- Variable/function-Hoisting

- this in JavaScript and how it differs from what we know from Java/.net.

- Function Closures and the JavaScript Module Pattern

- User-defined Callback Functions (writing functions that take a callback)

- Explain the methods map, filter and reduce

- Provide examples of user-defined reusable modules implemented in Node.js (learnynode - 6)

- Provide examples and explain the es2015 features: let, arrow functions, this, rest parameters, destructuring objects and arrays,   maps/sets etc.

- Provide an example of ES6 inheritance and reflect over the differences between Inheritance in Java and in ES6.

- Explain and demonstrate, how to implement event-based code, how to emit events and how to listen for such events

## ES6,7,8,ES-next and TypeScript

- Provide examples with es-next, running in a browser, using Babel and Webpack

- Explain the two strategies for improving JavaScript: Babel and ES6 + ES-Next, versus Typescript. What does it require to use these technologies: In our backend with Node and in (many different) Browsers

- Provide examples to demonstrate the benefits of using TypeScript, including, types, interfaces, classes and generics

- Explain how we can get typescript code completion for external imports.

- Explain the ECMAScript Proposal Process for how new features are added to the language (the TC39 Process)

## Callbacks, Promises and async/await
Explain about (ES-6) promises in JavaScript including, the problems they solve, a quick explanation of the Promise API and:

- Example(s) that demonstrate how to implement our own promise-solutions.

- Example(s) that demonstrate error handling with promises

- Example(s) that demonstrate how to execute asynchronous (promise-based) code in serial or parallel

Explain about JavaScripts async/await, how it relates to promises and reasons to use it compared to the plain promise API.

Provide examples to demonstrate
- Why this often is the preferred way of handling promise
  
-  Error handling with async/await
  
- Serial or parallel execution with async/await.
